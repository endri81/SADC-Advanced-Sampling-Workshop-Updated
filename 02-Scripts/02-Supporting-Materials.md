### 10.2 Key Teaching Points
```markdown
## Essential Messages for Tuesday

1. **Complexity is necessary** - Simple methods fail in reality
2. **Standards matter** - Follow WB/Eurostat/UN guidelines
3. **Document everything** - Your protection and credibility
4. **Plan for failure** - Crises are certain
5. **People matter most** - Behind every number is a life

## Common Misconceptions to Address
- "Bigger sample always better" - No, design matters more
- "Weights are optional" - No, they're essential
- "70% response is failure" - No, it's the new reality
- "Special populations impossible" - No, just need special methods
```
