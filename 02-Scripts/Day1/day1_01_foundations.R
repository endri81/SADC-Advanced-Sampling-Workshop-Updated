# DAY 1: HARRY'S FIRST MISSION
# Solving Anya's Request with Simple Random Sampling
# Dr. Endri Ra√ßo
# 
# Context: It's Monday morning. Harry just received an urgent email from
# Director Anya Sharma requesting an estimate of average household size
# from a frame of 10,000 households. This script documents Harry's solution.
#===============================================================================

# Load the tools Harry needs
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation
library(here)       # For file paths

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 1: Harry's Initial Exploration (Run lines 20-45)
# "Let me make sure I understand how this sampling thing works in R..."
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Harry's thought: "First, let me try with a tiny example - just 10 households"

# Create a mini sampling frame for practice
mini_frame <- 1:10
print("Harry's practice frame (10 households):")
print(mini_frame)

# Harry's lottery method in R
set.seed(123)  # Harry picks a random number to document his work
practice_sample <- sample(mini_frame, size = 3)

print("Harry randomly selected these 3 households:")
print(practice_sample)

# Harry verifies: "Did each household have equal probability?"
# Probability = n/N = 3/10 = 0.3
print("Probability each household had of being selected: 3/10 = 0.3")

# Harry's confidence boost:
print("‚úì Success! If this works for 10, it will work for 10,000!")

# Harry's note to self:
# "The sample() function is literally doing a lottery draw.
#  It's not programming magic - it's implementing the statistical 
#  method I learned in university!"

To: Anya Sharma
From: Harry Statistician  
Date: Monday, September 22, 2025, 4:30 PM
Subject: Re: Urgent: Pilot Data for the Household Income Survey

Hi Anya,

Great news! I've completed the analysis you requested.

RESULTS:
‚Ä¢ Estimated average household size: 3.54 persons
‚Ä¢ 95% Confidence Interval: [3.42, 3.66] persons
‚Ä¢ Margin of error: ¬±0.12 persons

METHODOLOGY:
I used Simple Random Sampling to select 500 households from the 
frame of 10,000 (5% sampling fraction). The estimate is unbiased 
and highly precise.

The full report with documentation is attached. All analysis was 
done in R with seed 2025, so you can reproduce these exact results.

The estimate is ready for the Ministry's resource allocation decisions.
Please let me know if you need any additional analysis.

Best regards,
Harry

P.S. - R made this incredibly efficient. What would have taken days 
       was completed in hours!
