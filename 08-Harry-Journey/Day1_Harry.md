# Harry's Journey - Day 1: The Beginning

## Meet Harry

Harry is a statistician at the National Statistical Office. He's been working 
with surveys for 5 years, but always using point-and-click software.

Today, his director called him in:

> 'Harry, we need to modernize our survey operations. I'm sending you to learn R.
> By Friday, I expect you to handle our entire household survey pipeline in R.'

Harry feels nervous but excited. He's heard R can do amazing things, but he's
never written a line of code in his life.

## Today's Challenge

The director hands Harry a USB drive:

> 'Here's data from 10,000 households. I need you to:
> 1. Take a simple random sample of 500 households
> 2. Calculate the sampling error
> 3. Document everything so others can replicate it'

Harry takes a deep breath. Let's help him succeed!
